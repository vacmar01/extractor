# Extract0r

Extract0r is a little web app that let's you extract structured data from text. In the background it uses [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/) as well as Llama 3.1 8b through [Together.ai](https://together.ai). 

It uses my private API key, so let's see how much of my free credits you can destroy üòÅ

Also it's build with the new [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml) framework by [Answer.ai](https://answer.ai) and is my playground to try stuff with this new technology.
